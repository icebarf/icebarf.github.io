Hellsing Ultimate is one of the coolest animes I have ever watched.
It is set in modern England, where the protestant organization Hellsing eliminates supernatural
freaks but primarily deal with Vampires and Ghouls. They have their **garbage collector**, Alucard (anadrome of Dracula)
a vampire, nay, The Count—the OG vampire: Vlad. The anime has a lot of really cool characters
that are pretty much introduced in the first two episodes—Alucard, Sir Integra, Walter, Priest Anderson.
There's a few that come up later on but I dont really remember anyone impressive. It has been quite a while
since I last watched it.

## Art Style and Soundtrack

It's an anime from the 2000s and is faithful to the art style of
the era. I'm a big sucker for anime that came out before 2015, going back to the 80s or the
90s. It's something about that art that naturally evolved from back then up until like the 2013.
I'm not really talking about the CG aspect but the hand-drawn stuff.
Modern drawn art style feels a bit plastic-y maybe due to the fact that it is digital, if that makes sense to you.
That is not to say that modern art is somehow bad or not real or whatever. I dont want to get into that
so lets move onto the music.

The sound design of the anime is really good. It doesn't have an opening or an ending video like most animes.
It is pure content with the music being part of the story itself.

The anime has a lot of christian inspired themes, so the soundtracks are reminiscent
of really cool church/classical music that vibes really well. There's also modern rock-ish sound as well with
really cool bass solos. Sometimes the music just feels like it is from those action shooter games
with awesome vibes. I wouldn't call the music in this anime the best, but it really fits.

## Characters
Alucard is a really cool character that you get to see various aspects of as the anime progresses.
I think he's the most fleshed out character compared to the rest,
a close second would be Sir Integra (who's actually a lady but holds the Sir title because duh).
She's a strong leader with really powerful subordinates like Walter (the butler and former "garbage collector"), Seras and Alucard. You get to see how she comes into power and hold of the organization as a young girl, 
the anime starts there I think.

There's rival organizations which are all antagonistic to each other.
They're the Catholic Church (from Vatican City) and the [REDACTED]s. The last one is a spoiler, it wasn't that much of a surprise but it is a major plot point... It also plays into the alt history genre with this, which I really like.

Speaking of the Catholic Church, Priest Anderson is another of my favorite characters from the show.
He's a buff fighting priest who has a super good Voice Actor—Norio Wakamoto. The VA makes the character just
feel so so much alive. I felt like Alucard and Anderson had one of the best VAs in the anime, with [REDACTED]'s
leader coming after. This isn't really an objective judgement, rather, it is what I think that "fits" the characters
the most. 

The best girl of the anime: Seras, is a character that you see tag along with Alucard, she's turned into a Draculina
by him in the first episode. As the anime progresses, we see her explore more of her powers. She's actually a
tank-like powerhouse with the destructive weapons she uses. Honestly, it's one of my favorite things about her which I find
cute.

## Plot

The plot revolves around Europe with the [REDACTED] organization trying to regain power and cause chaos.
I never understood why these losers were trying to do anything because they seemed like just true psychopaths who
have BPD. Pure agents of chaos.

Hellsing and The Catholic Church are also at odds because Protestant vs. Catholic. Both organizations
have their own powerhouses. There's Maxwell from the church who's a two faced piece of shit honestly.
You should watch the anime to figure out why. Atleast Anderson, while being an asshole, is honest and
kind-of cool about his hate.

The fights are satisfying, and pure fun throughout the anime, to the end. We see a
combination of Vampire powers and modern weaponry which is a fusion i really like. I'm a big sucker
for anything vampire related to be honest.
The ending of the anime is just EPIC and hype.
The way Alucard joins in and reveals his true power is truly grand. I wont talk too much about it
since I would like you to appreciate the whole thing yourself.
