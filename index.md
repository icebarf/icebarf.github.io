# Icebarf's Website

Hi This is Icebarf's personal website. I've created this website to share anything I want with the internet.

I am a C programmer and I love to do low level stuff. Here's what I've worked on:

- [A Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/icebarf/dy-chip8)
- [A performance mode utility for ASUS Laptops on Linux](https://github.com/icebarf/perfmode)
- [Augustus - A Discord Bot written in C](https://github.com/icebarf/Augustus)

Currently working on a compiler for a toy/esoteric language called [WISE](https://github.com/icebarf/wise-compiler).
