A really short sci-fi manga that dives into the human heart.

4 volumes, 24 chapters.

Initially, I found it similar to Venom (marvel :d ) and an anime I watched
years ago where some Ojisan and some young dude their bodies replaced
by aliens.

But my opinions changed later on while reading through the 2nd volume.
Then I found it more similar to Venom and うずまき's body horror.
But that's just me drawing connections.

While not trying to go into the details of the actual plot, I want
to talk about the human emotions—those are the underlying
concepts that the mangaka wanted the reader to understand
(atleast that is what I feel like).
It convolves around trauma, lack of social skills, familial trouble, introversion
and the like—which I personally relate-to to some degree.

I liked how the main character ヒカル navigates most of the situations
and there's a nice cleanup at the end where she appears to be free from
her troubles. Honestly, it's a very short read and I recommend that you try
it as well.

I'm a super slow at reading because I'm very new to japanese, and have not read that much :(
