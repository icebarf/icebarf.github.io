      <description>Learnt Linked Lists (in C ). Need practice Renovated website. We (re-)launched(?)  So&amp;hellip; Yesterday I said I would read Beej&amp;rsquo;s guide and try to finish that in 2-3 days. Well, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even read the guide, I just spent half of my day randomly spending time on Together C &amp;amp; C++ Discord and renovating my website. The took a small afternoon nap. The started learning Data structures, well to be more precise Linked Lists, to be even more precise Singly Linked Lists.</description>

      <description>Re-started reading Beej&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Network Programming Added token exception handling to bot  Okay Now I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing and will do, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that mall0cd&amp;rsquo;s library might need a re write due to an issue caused by libjansson.h. I planned on helping him continue his work but after some debugging with my bot we realised that library was fundamentally flawed due to the JSON parser as indicated by valgrind.</description>
