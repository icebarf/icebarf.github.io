## Thoughts

I recently read my first light novel, and an actual book in Japanese.
This article entails my impressions of the book ぜんぶ、藍色だった.
To give you the premise, it's set in a school with the characters being
in their mid teens.

The story's mostly from the perspective of the female lead [透花]{とうか}.
She meets a new [転校生]{てんこうせ} called [藍]{あい} who seems to be having some
memory troubles.
It's mostly a teenage romance thing with an unexpected genre twist after the middle chapters.
The story didn't feel as *boring* as I expected it to be due to the troupey nature.
After the twist, I was genuinely hooked into the story, to see how it would play out.

The ending was quite satisying, although with the special big reveal at the end —
I couldn't help but feel "I should've seen it coming". But maybe that was for the
better since I wouldn't have gotten so engrossed with the story if I'd guessed it.

I mostly had no trouble keeping up with overall plot and many of the crucial details
while reading the book. I chose the book because it was very short compared to the
others. I believe it is around 42k 文字.
