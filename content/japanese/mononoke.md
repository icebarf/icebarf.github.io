Mononoke is an anime that absolutely slaps you in the face with its magnificent
art style and a captive story. It is like a moving representation of human emotion,
and cultural references.

When I first started watching it, I was kind of weirded out by its raw-ness. The 
art style is like you're watching an old style moving japanese painting.
I have never seen anything like it before. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say
that I kept watching the anime even though I found the first arc relatively boring
(first and second episode). That is not to say that the story itself is boring.
The anime itself seems to be set in the late 1800s.

I really like how the main character approaches to dealing with the three aspects
of [モノノ怪]{もののけ}. Namely [形]{かたち}, [真]{まこと}, and [理]{ことわり}.
He has a really cool (albeit short) weapon, and an alternative form which I dont
exactly understand what it is—current guess is that it's a もののけ. Or rather,
the [薬売り]{くすりうり} is part-mononoke.

I think you should absolutely give it a try, as it's a very unique anime.
It's very accessible, even if you're a little バカ人.
