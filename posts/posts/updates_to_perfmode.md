# The future of perfmode

As the author of perfmode, it is my duty to keep it updated and add new
functionality to it and doing bug fixes. However, recently due to some real
life situations - I have not been able to provide updates as much.

That is why I have planned a few updates to the codebase and the functionality
of perfmode itself.

## version - 3.1.1

This version will contain mostly bug fixes and changes to codebase. No major
features will be added.

**Update - 18 December 2021 - 21:02:50**

Changelog:

- Remove `gtk4` as a dependency
- Remove gui in support for future release
- FIX! - when no argument was passed along `perfmode -l` program would segfault
- replace internal data structures - from macros to arrays and enums

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/icebarf/perfmode/compare/2.1.0...3.1.1

## version - 3.1.2

This version fixes the bad codebase release plus additional cleanup to codebase.

**Updated on 20 December 2021 - sometime around evening**

Changelog:

- Fix bad code from previous release
- Better error reporting
- Troubleshooting guide updated on github
- Cleaner code comments

## version - 3.2.2

This version gets updates regarding the faustus module. Earlier versions of 
perfmode added support for faustus - mainly regarding the boosts/fan control.

LED Backlight Control was available for the asus/default module only. But now 
this updated will add support for it.

**Updated on 25 December 2021 - 22:27:05**

Changelog:

Rewrite whole thing, fixes bugs, better error reporting, very clean 
code-base compared to previous one.

## version - 4.2.1

This version will **possibly** have a GUI Rewrite. In previous versions
GUI was made with the GTK Toolchain. I do not wish to be dependent on this
toolchain solely for personal reasons and the old GUI was **very bad**.

The update will focus on a complete GUI Overhaul.

> Changelog will be added here as soon as the update is released.
