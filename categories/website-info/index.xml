      <description>Deprecated While talking to a good friend of mine, He recommended me a static site generator called Hugo. It is a quite a powerful tool and has many themes and support for templates from other web programming languages/markup languages. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into much detail now but it is how it is. Anyways, we both found this cool theme that we&amp;rsquo;re using right now and it is called hugo.386. It took me about 2-3 Hours to configure everything right along with some trial and error on some areas and now we&amp;rsquo;re here.</description>
