## Thoughts

I recently read my first light novel, and an actual book in Japanese.
Here are my impressions of the book 「ぜんぶ、藍色だった」.

To give you the premise, it's set in a school with the characters being
in their mid teens.
The story's mostly from the perspective of the female lead [透花]{とうか}.
Early on, she meets a new [転校生]{てんこうせい} named [藍]{あい}.
They click on initially through their love of the color「藍」(tr: Indigo),
as 透花 liked to often paint with it.
Both of the characters seem to be lonely in their own world, with small interactions
spread throughout the chapters in the early parts of the book.
It's mostly a teenage romance thing with an unexpected genre twist after the middle chapters.

> SPOILERS AHEAD!

It's revealed that 藍 is actually an AI Robot who seems to have been "born"
after his older brother died. Although, not directly said, I believe rather than
being the *little brother*, it's actually the human 藍's memories are somehow
implanted into this robot.

In the later parts of the book,
there's a chapter where we see the world from a child 藍's perspective. He meets
a little girl at the hotel lobby and they decide to play together the next day
at the pool.
Keep in mind, this little girl *also* likes [藍色]{あいいろ} and paints with it.
To summarize, 藍's late to the pool and the little girl is dead — floating in the
pool, and he's kind-of traumatized by the incident.

Then the story continues with the main romance plot, and at the end 透花 reveals she's
also an AI. 

> SPOILERS END

After the twist/big reveal,
I was genuinely hooked into the story, to see how it would play out.
The ending was quite satisying, although with the special big reveal at the end —
I couldn't help but feel "I should've seen it coming". But maybe that was for the
better since I wouldn't have gotten so engrossed with the story if I'd guessed it.

The story didn't feel as *boring* as I expected it to be. There were some parts where
I wanted to stop reading because of my low level of comprehension.I mostly had no
trouble keeping up with overall plot and many of the crucial details
while reading the book. But overall, it was worth reading the book.
It is a very short book — 42k 文字.
